Early Bird

A game where you hunt for birds. As a worm.

Built for: Celestia Infinite Space Bazaar hackathon

Background: Last summer I was watching the American Robins hop around in my backyard and realized they move as if powered by an algorithm while hunting for worms. I had the idea to make a silly game to imitate their process. This is that game. 

Tech used:

Game: the game is built using the HTML5 canvas element & javascript with images stored on IPFS & pinned by Pinata.
